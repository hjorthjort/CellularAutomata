# Cellular Automata

A web application for simulating and painting cellular automata.

## Usage

Visit main.html, input desired values, and run. Take care to not run with very
large widths and heights, as the complexity of rendering is `O(width*height)`.

## Current capabilities

* One dimensional, binary automata.
